# CS2-Water-Flow-Assignment-

The aim of this assignment was to create a java application which - through the use concurrency and multithreading - would be able to effectively simulate the effect of water running over a terrain. Specifically the simulation must show how water flows downhill on the terrain, accumulates in the basins(local-minimums of the terrain height matrix) and lastly flows off the edges of the terrain

The program can be run by using the command java flow medsample_in.txt
